export const mockLinearTicket = `Objectives (overall perspective about product/engineering)

      Create the form

      wire up the query call to check for/get existing data for the input

      wire up the mutation call to send the data

      send an event to BloomReach (?). Data capture for BR is handled on a separate data ticket. 

      next button should be disabled until the user fills in the information (?) => This is not a required field, so the next button should always be enabled. 

      Note display requirements:

      When a location is clicked from the autocomplete, a chip (with the "x") should display within the section below. 

      Clicking the "x" should remove the chip from the section. 

      Destinations should not be added twice.

      use the project's config (BOOK-3341) to handle the next's step redirecting

      export the background image and use the layout component from BOOK-3345

      Note:

      create unit tests for query, mutation, data layer's push, and next button state orchestration (from disable to active)

      check with @kevin.taylor the correct query/mutation for this one

      Acceptance Criteria / Task's expected output
